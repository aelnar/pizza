OUTLINE

Info:
Based on Red Velvet's Peek-a-Boo MV.

Plot:
You play as the pizza guy trying to escape Red Velvet's clutches in a story-based game.

Gameplay:
- At the beginning, the pizza guy is given a random trait to stick to -> stay calm, stay vigilant, etc.
- Red Velvet will try to get pizza guy to...not stick to trait -> if calm, try to scare him; if vigilant, try to disuade him, etc.
- Pizza guy wins if he manages to escape; Red Velvet wins if they're able to capture pizza guy.
- Depending on points, whoever pizza guy trusts the most will give the ending of the game. 

Red Velvet (what are they going to do):
- 6 chapters, 5 of which emphasize a specific girl.
- Whoever's chapter it is gets an "AI" -> Character class w/ each girl as a chara variable, which is passed through some sort of FSM/behavior tree situation
- Depending on player/pizza guy's answer to situation, will pick the best option to make sure that pizza guy doesn't escape
- Some sort of points system for the last chapter/ending.
