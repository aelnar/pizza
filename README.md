# Outline

Ver 2.0

Now What Does Ver 2.0 Mean:
- Changes to gameplay!
  - Letting player piece together clues to further game
  - Adding randomness in how house will be "built"
- Will be working on story + design over spring break.
- Yeah this is basically my to-do list.

Info:
- Based on Red Velvet's Peek-a-Boo MV
- Will be written in Python

Plot:
You play as the pizza guy trying to escape Red Velvet's clutches.

Gameplay (But With Categories This Time):
- Overall Structure:
  - Player is given house where at first all the rooms are "locked" -> rooms are "unlocked" after finishing a chapter
  - Pizza guy wins if he manages to escape; unlocks all rooms + manages to score high enough in all chapters + manages to figure out how to get out
  - Red Velvet wins if they're able to capture pizza guy
  - Depending on points, whoever pizza guy trusts the most will give the ending of the game.
- Rooms:
  - Will have some sort of "mini-game" where player has to pay attention to what girls are saying
  - Some sort of "piece together response" game -> some words are highlighted and added to word bank, at certain points of chapter
    player will have chance to piece together a response with those words -> purpose is to either show girls that player is onto
    what they're doing or to disuade them from thinking that you know something depending on scenario (up to player discretion)
  - Points awarded on whether or not response is good or bad
- House:
  - Unlocks for chapters
  - Random set-up each time
  - Chapters will have hints on what is the correct order to go through -> need to figure out
    correct order of rooms to really escape through reading story + having correct responses
   - So like one playthrough could have path Attic -> Living Room -> etc.. -> Main Entrance
   - Path determined at the start randomly
   - If score is really high at end but correct path not found, neutral ending like in MV?

Red Velvet (what are they going to do):
- 6 chapters, 5 of which emphasize a specific girl.
- Will be going off of player's responses -> if player's response scores high points, then they'll try and disuade player
  but if player's response scores low points, then they'll drop more hints for next time player has to respond
- Maybe they could also riff off of how Pac-Man's ghosts have different personalities and affects how
  aggressive they give hints + pressure player maybe? That's actually a good idea hold on
- Some sort of points system for the last chapter/ending and who'll deliver it.
